# f21scrapejs
'15 HackRU - Node.js/Express.js scraper for the product page of forever21.

Clone the repo and use `node example.js` to run it. Change the `link` in `/example.js` to any forever21 product page to get the price, title, and imageUrl. Could optimize to be more general purpose but this was just an exercise for hackRU.
